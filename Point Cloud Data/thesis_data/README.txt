* FORMAT

In the mesh files (*.m), each vertex has the form:

Vertex 1  18.0547 -52.1511 32.0551

- The "1" is the vertex index; note that indices start at 1, not 0.

- The next 3 floats are the X,Y,Z positions in the original mesh.

- The "normal" field is the Nx,Ny,Nz vertex normal.


* CODE

Sorry, the code is not presently available.
